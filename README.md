## Getting Started

These instructions will get you started on the project.

### Installing

In order to get the files on your local hard drive, I recommend using git

    git clone https://github.com/joonanykanen/nelilaskin

### Running the app

You need to download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) in order to get the full emulation working.

Then you are able to build the app into apk as well.
